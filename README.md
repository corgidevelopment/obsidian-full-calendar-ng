# Full Calendar Plugin

- I forked this plugin, since there hasn't been any progress on it for quite a time
- __First Goal__: Enable Two-Way-Sync for CalDAV-Calendars (primarily Nextcloud)
- __Second Goal__: Display-Support for CalDAV-Calendars, that support tasks
- __Drive-By Benefit__: Updated dependencies

- Other Stuff: I have yet to think off, maybe I will visit feature requests and bugs of the original project

#### Support this Plugin ðŸ˜‡ :

Next, you see the original README.md from the source project (yet I removed installation statistics and Ko-Fi link)

> Keep your calendar in your vault! This plugin integrates the [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) library into your Obsidian Vault so that you can keep your ever-changing daily schedule and special events and plans alongside your tasks and notes, and link freely between all of them. Each event is stored as a separate note with special frontmatter so you can take notes, form connections and add context to any event on your calendar.
>
> Full Calendar can pull events from frontmatter on notes, or from event lists in daily notes. Full Calendar also supports read-only ICS and CalDAV remote calendars.
> 
> You can find the full documentation [here](https://obsidian-community.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/)!

> 
> The FullCalendar library is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) by [Adam Shaw](https://github.com/arshaw). It's an awesome piece of work, and it would not have been possible to make something like this plugin so easily without it.
